Investigate tiled LtL/HROT algorithm
LtL, HROT and Generations fix patterns hitting boundary (use DELETERANGE stuff rather than just clear)
Investigate Paul's non-totalistic hex notation
Investigate Brian's BSFKL notation
Investigate "Extended" Generations
Investigate deficient rules
Meta world view
Grow grid separately horizontally and vertically to allow grid sizes like 16384x1024
User preferences
[STARTED]Memory footprint reduction
    - don't allocate sin and cos tables until first use
    [DONE]Stars allocated on first use
    [DONE]Default grid size 512x512
    [DONE]Don't allocate population data if [[ NOGRAPH ]] specified, or if [[ THUMBLAUNCH ]] without [[ GRAPH ]] specified
    [DONE]Population data is now dynamically allocated
[STARTED]Implement faster Ltl/HROT von Neumann algorithm
[STARTED]Pattern Editor
    [DONE] Basic 2-state editing with no undo
[DONE]HROT support for von Neumann and Circular neighbourhoods
[DONE]New script keywords to put labels on the display at specific locations triggered by generation and zoom ranges
[DONE]multistate rules using just 2 states should use LifeViewer Themes
[DONE]getState() needs to cope with Bounded Grid and 255 or 256 states (currently bounded grid border showing as 1, should be 0)
[DONE]multistate rules using > 2 states and < 256 states should have history colour
[DONE]LABELTRACK DX DY command to allow labels to move over generations
