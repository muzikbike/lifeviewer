Investigate:
    Brian's BSFKL notation
    "extended" Generations
    Deficient rules
    half-integer Wolfram rules
    LtL Margolus rules
    grow grid separately horizontally and vertically to allow grid sizes like 16384x1024
    user preferences

Planned:
    menu items coordinates should be reflected based on compass position
    fit grid with hex patterns

In progress:
[STARTED]add type information for closure compiler
[STARTED]Triangular neighbourhood
    - square bounded grids
    - need to optimize triangular grid lines using lines across width and height of window
    - optimize triangular algo for two cell lookup
    [DONE]drawing should use triangles and not squares for cell
    [DONE]Triangular grid Copy RLE needs to cope with odd/even cells
    [DONE]build triangular lookup array
    [DONE]build next generation function
    [DONE]triangle renderer
    [DONE]decode triangular neighbourhood rules
    [DONE]support Triangular, Triangular Edges and Triangular Vertices neighbourhoods
    [DONE]B0 rules
[STARTED]Rule Table rules
    - decode @TABLE, @COLORS and @ICONS
    - implement rule table and rule tree algorithms
    [DONE]decode @TREE
    [DONE]search after RLE terminating ! character for rule table sections
[STARTED]Pattern Editor
    - ability to define rule
    - improved LifeHistory drawing modes
    - reset to include the overlay grid
    - selections
        [DONE]10 clipboards
        [DONE]square selection
        [DONE]auto-shrink selection on/off
        - name selection
        [DONE]flip X selection
        [DONE]flip Y selection
        [DONE]rotate CW selection
        [DONE]rotate CCW selection
        [DONE]set random fill percentage
        [DONE]random fill selection
        [DONE]random 2-state fill selection
        [DONE]clear cells in selection
        [DONE]invert cells in selection
        - copy library or named snippet to buffer
        [DONE]copy selection to buffer
        [DONE]cut selection to buffer
        [DONE]flip X buffer
        [DONE]flip Y buffer
        [DONE]rotate CW buffer
        [DONE]rotate CCW buffer
        [DONE]random fill buffer
        [DONE]random 2-state fill buffer
        [DONE]clear cells in selection
        [DONE]invert cells in selection
        [DONE]copy buffer to current position
        [DONE]copy buffer to selection
    [DONE]undo stack / step back
    [DONE]grow grid if possible when cell outside current grid drawn
    [DONE]2-state editing
    [DONE]LifeHistory support
    [DONE]multi-state support
    [DONE]colour picker
    [DONE]convert current pattern to RLE (for Ctrl-C Copy)

Complete:
[DONE]Delete boundary gliders
[DONE]Optional border around square, hexagonal or triangular cells
[DONE]setState should check for tile boundaries and set adjacent tiles
[DONE]Paul's non-totalistic hex notation
[DONE]#CXRLE Pos limits
[DONE]Multiverse
[DONE]Alternating rules
[DONE]LtL, HROT and Generations fix patterns hitting boundary (use DELETERANGE rather than just clear)
[DONE]Memory footprint reduction
[DONE]Implement faster Ltl/HROT von Neumann algorithm
[DONE]HROT support for von Neumann and Circular neighbourhoods
[DONE]New script keywords to put annotations (labels, arrows or polygons) on the display at specific locations triggered by generation and/or zoom ranges
[DONE]multistate rules using just 2 states should use LifeViewer Themes
[DONE]getState() needs to cope with Bounded Grid and 255 or 256 states (currently bounded grid border showing as 1, should be 0)
[DONE]multistate rules using > 2 states and < 256 states should have history colour
[DONE]LABELTRACK DX DY command to allow labels to move over generations
[DONE]grey out individual items in a UI list control
[DONE]pause playback during drawing
[DONE]bottom right menu items should be relative to middle column so they cluster on wide windows
