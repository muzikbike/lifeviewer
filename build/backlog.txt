Investigate:
    Rule Table rules
    Brian's BSFKL notation
    "Extended" Generations
    Deficient rules
    Half-integer Wolfram rules
    LtL Margolus rules
    Grow grid separately horizontally and vertically to allow grid sizes like 16384x1024

Planned:
    User preferences

In progress:
[STARTED]Pattern Editor
    - ability to define rule
    - improved LifeHistory drawing modes
    - reset to include the overlay grid
    - undo stack
    - selections
    [DONE]grow grid if possible when cell outside current grid drawn
    [DONE]2-state editing
    [DONE]LifeHistory support
    [DONE]multi-state support
    [DONE]colour picker
    [DONE]convert current pattern to RLE (for Ctrl-C Copy)

Complete:
[DONE]Paul's non-totalistic hex notation
[DONE]#CXRLE Pos limits
[DONE]Multiverse
[DONE]Alternating rules
[DONE]LtL, HROT and Generations fix patterns hitting boundary (use DELETERANGE rather than just clear)
[DONE]Memory footprint reduction
[DONE]Implement faster Ltl/HROT von Neumann algorithm
[DONE]HROT support for von Neumann and Circular neighbourhoods
[DONE]New script keywords to put annotations (labels, arrows or polygons) on the display at specific locations triggered by generation and/or zoom ranges
[DONE]multistate rules using just 2 states should use LifeViewer Themes
[DONE]getState() needs to cope with Bounded Grid and 255 or 256 states (currently bounded grid border showing as 1, should be 0)
[DONE]multistate rules using > 2 states and < 256 states should have history colour
[DONE]LABELTRACK DX DY command to allow labels to move over generations
