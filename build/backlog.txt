User preferences
[STARTED]Meta world view
- extend Controller to provide access to all patterns on a page
- new script command [[ MULTI ]] to switch to meta world view
- new UI control somewhere to switch back
[STARTED]Pattern Editor
    [DONE] 2-state editing
    [DONE]LifeHistory support
    [DONE]multi-state support
    [DONE]colour picker
    - improved LifeHistory drawing modes
    - reset to include the overlay grid
    - convert current pattern to RLE (for Ctrl-C Copy)
    - undo stack
    - selections
[DONE]Alternating rules
[DONE]LtL, HROT and Generations fix patterns hitting boundary (use DELETERANGE stuff rather than just clear)
[DONE]Memory footprint reduction
[DONE]Implement faster Ltl/HROT von Neumann algorithm
[DONE]HROT support for von Neumann and Circular neighbourhoods
[DONE]New script keywords to put labels on the display at specific locations triggered by generation and zoom ranges
[DONE]multistate rules using just 2 states should use LifeViewer Themes
[DONE]getState() needs to cope with Bounded Grid and 255 or 256 states (currently bounded grid border showing as 1, should be 0)
[DONE]multistate rules using > 2 states and < 256 states should have history colour
[DONE]LABELTRACK DX DY command to allow labels to move over generations
